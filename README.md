# BotaniaConfigurator
A kind of port of [BotaniaTweaker](https://github.com/Tfarcenim/BotaniaTweaker) for 1.20.1 Fabric.
Adds configurability to most of the functional and generating flowers.

For most of the functional flowers, you can adjust:
- Mana capacities,
- Mana usages,
- Ranges/Radii.

Some flowers also have some sort of a delay, which is also configurable with this mod.

The config is available in-game (TODO) or in `botania_configurator.json5` file.
