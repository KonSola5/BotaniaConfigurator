# BotaniaConfigurator
A kind of enhanced port of [BotaniaTweaker](https://github.com/Tfarcenim/BotaniaTweaker) for 1.20.1 Fabric.
Adds configurability to most of the functional and generating flowers.

For most of the functional and generating flowers, you can adjust:
- Mana Capacities,
- Mana Generation Rates,
- Mana Usages,
- Ranges/Radii.

Some flowers also have some sort of delay, which is also configurable with this mod.

The config is available in-game or in `botaniaconfigurator.json` file.
